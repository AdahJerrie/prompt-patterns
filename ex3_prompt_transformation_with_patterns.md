1. ## Under-specified or Vague prompt
"Explain the concept prompt engineering."

### AI's output
"Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining the instructions given to an AI system so it produces the most accurate, useful, and relevant responses. It involves choosing clear wording, adding context or constraints, and structuring requests in a way that guides the model’s reasoning. Effective prompt engineering helps users get better results without changing the underlying AI model."

2. ### Instructional pattern
"Use 2-3 sentences to explain the concept of prompt engineering to a high school student."

### AI's output
"Prompt engineering is the skill of writing clear and specific instructions so an AI understands exactly what you want it to do. By choosing the right words, details, and examples, you can get better, more accurate answers from the AI."

### Comparative pattern
"Compare the effect of a poorly constructed prompt on the end user vs that of a well-constructed prompt in 3 bullet points."

### AI's output
* A poorly constructed prompt often leads to vague, incorrect, or irrelevant responses, while a well-constructed prompt produces clear, accurate, and useful results.
* Poor prompts can frustrate users and waste time due to repeated clarifications, whereas good prompts improve efficiency and confidence in the AI’s output.
* Weak prompts reduce the reliability of AI assistance, while strong prompts enable consistent, predictable, and higher-quality interactions.


3. From the under-specified prompt, the AI's output is quite generic.
After modifying the prompt to instructional pattern, I discoveed that the output was more definite and precise. Then going further to the comparative pattern, the AI's output became more precise as it highlighted what I see to be the most important points.
